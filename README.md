# CryptoAlertsBot Project

This project at its core consists of a simple Node application which interfaces with the Coinbase API to retrieve current prices for BTC and ETH, which will then use to calculate above/below price percentages and trigger an alert through a Telegram bot, messaging the user who has set it up.
